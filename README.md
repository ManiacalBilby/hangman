# Hangman Project
### Overview

For the first project I chose to do a "Hangman" game.

When the site is visited there will be a set of instructions displayed.

The player will click a letter from the alphabet box. If the letter is in the hidden word it will be displayed in each place it occurs. If it is incorrect the letter will be discarded and a incorrect guess counter will decrease by 1. Guesses will continue until the word is complete or 6 incorrect guesses have been used.
