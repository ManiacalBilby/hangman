# Hangman Project
### Overview

For the first project I chose to do a "Hangman" style game with a western theme.


The player will click a letter from the alphabet box. If the letter is in the hidden word it will be displayed in each place it occurs. If it is incorrect the letter will fade and an incorrect guess counter will decrease by 1. Guesses will continue until the word is complete or 6 incorrect guesses have been used.
